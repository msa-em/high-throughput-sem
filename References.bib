   abstract = {In this review, automatic defect inspection algorithms that analyze Electron Microscope (EM) images of Semiconductor Manufacturing (SM) products are identified, categorized, and discussed. This is a topic of critical importance for the SM industry as the continuous shrinking of device patterns has led to increasing defectivity and a greater prevalence of higher-resolution imaging tools such as EM. These aspects among others threaten to increase costs as a result of increased inspection time-to-solution and decreased yield, respectively. Relevant research papers were systematically identified in four popular publication databases in January 2024. A total of 103 papers were selected after screening for novel contributions relating to automatic EM image analysis algorithms for semiconductor defect inspection. These papers were then categorized based on the inspection tasks they addressed, their evaluation metrics, and the type of algorithms used. A notable finding from this categorization is that reference-based defect detection algorithms were the most popular algorithm type until 2020 when deep learning-based inspection algorithms became more popular, especially for defect classification. Furthermore, four broader research questions were discussed to come to the following conclusions: (i) the key components of inspection algorithms are set up, pre-processing, feature extraction, and final prediction; (ii) the maturity of the manufacturing process affects the data availability and required sensitivity of inspection algorithms; (iii) key challenges for these algorithms relate to the desiderata of minimizing time-to-solution which pushes for high imaging throughput, reducing manual input during algorithm setup, and higher processing throughput; and (iv) three promising directions for future work are suggested based on gaps in the reviewed literature that address key remaining limitations.},

   abstract = {The role of quality control based on images is important in industrial production. Nevertheless, this problem has not been addressed in computer vision for a long time. In recent years, this has changed: driven by publicly available datasets, a variety of methods have been proposed for detecting anomalies and defects in workpieces. In this survey, we present more than 40 methods that promise the best results for this task. In a comprehensive benchmark, we show that more datasets and metrics are needed to move the field forward. Further, we highlight strengths and weaknesses, discuss research gaps and future research areas.},

   abstract = {Advanced electron microscopy techniques, including scanning electron microscopes (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), and transmission electron microscopes (TEM), have revolutionized imaging capabilities. However, achieving high-quality experimental images remains a challenge due to various distortions stemming from the instrumentation and external factors. These distortions, introduced at different stages of imaging, hinder the extraction of reliable quantitative insights. In this paper, we will discuss the main sources of distortion in TEM and S(T)EM images, develop models to describe them, and propose a method to correct these distortions using a convolutional neural network. We validate the effectiveness of our method on a range of simulated and experimental images, demonstrating its ability to significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. This improvement leads to a more reliable extraction of quantitative structural information from the images. In summary, our findings offer a robust framework to enhance the quality of electron microscopy images, which in turn supports progress in structural analysis and quantification in materials science and biology.},

   abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been widely utilized in the field of materials science due to its significant advantages, such as large depth of field, wide field of view, and excellent stereoscopic imaging. However, at high magnification, the limited imaging range in SEM cannot cover all the possible inhomogeneous microstructures. In this research, we propose a novel approach for generating high-resolution SEM images across multiple scales, enabling a single image to capture physical dimensions at the centimeter level while preserving submicron-level details. We adopted the SEM imaging on the AlCoCrFeNi2.1 eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) as an example. SEM videos and image stitching are combined to fulfill this goal, and the video-extracted low-definition (LD) images are clarified by a well-trained denoising model. Furthermore, we segment the macroscopic image of the EHEA, and area of various microstructures are distinguished. Combining the segmentation results and hardness experiments, we found that the hardness is positively correlated with the content of body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, negatively correlated with the lamella width, and the relationship with the proportion of lamellar structures was not significant. Our work provides a feasible solution to generate macroscopic images based on SEMs for further analysis of the correlations between the microstructures and spatial distribution, and can be widely applied to other types of microscope.},

   abstract = {Autonomous experimentation systems have been used to greatly advance the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering paradigm. This paper outlines a framework that enables the design and selection of data collection workflows for autonomous experimentation systems. The framework first searches for data collection workflows that generate high-quality information and then selects the workflow that generates the highest-value information as per a user-defined objective. We employ this framework to select the optimal high-throughput workflow for the characterization of an additively manufactured Ti–6Al–4V sample using a deep-learning based image denoiser. The selected workflow reduced the collection time of backscattered electron scanning electron microscopy images by a factor of 5 times as compared to the case study’s benchmark workflow, and by a factor of 85 times as compared to the workflow used in a previously published study.},
